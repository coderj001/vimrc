To Get Similar match vim as shown in picture above
You need to install few plugin,
You can use any vim package manager but I have use packloadall(which is vim built-in plugin manager).
Plugins

1. lightline.vim
2. onedark.vim
3. xtabline.vim

If you didn't install these plugins then don't uncomment the themes section in vimrc file.
